Key Relationships:

1. users - journals (One-to-Many)
    - A teacher ( role='teacher' ) can create multiple journals.
    - journals.teacher_id references users.id.

2. journals - attachments (One-to-Many)
    -  A journal can have multiple attachments.
    - attachments.journal_id references journals.id .

3. attachment_types -> attachments (One-to-Many)
    - Each attachment has one type (image/video/pdf/url).
    - attachments.attachment_type_id references attachment_types.id.

4. journals + users -> student journal_tags (Many-to-Many)
    - Journals can be tagged to multiple students ( role=' student' ).
    - Composite foreign keys: (journal_id, student_id)

5. users + journals - notifications (One-to-Many)
    - Notifications link students to journals.
    - notifications.student_id and notifications.journal_id are foreign keys.
